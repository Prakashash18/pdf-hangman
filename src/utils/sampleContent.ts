    text: `Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare their type explicitly. Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces. Functions are defined using the def keyword, and classes use the class keyword.

Python has extensive built-in data structures including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. The language includes powerful libraries like NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data analysis, and Django for web development.

Exception handling in Python uses try-except blocks. Python supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation as core object-oriented principles. The language includes decorators for modifying function behavior and generators for memory-efficient iteration.

Python's standard library is comprehensive, including modules for regular expressions, file handling, networking, and database connectivity. The language supports lambda functions for creating anonymous functions and includes powerful debugging tools.`,

    text: `Electronics is the branch of physics and engineering dealing with the behavior and effects of electrons and electronic devices. It encompasses the design and application of circuits using active components like transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits.

Basic electronic components include resistors, capacitors, inductors, and semiconductors. Ohm's law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. Kirchhoff's laws govern current and voltage in electrical circuits.

Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity between conductors and insulators. Diodes allow current flow in one direction, while transistors can amplify signals or act as switches. Integrated circuits combine multiple components on a single chip.

Digital electronics uses binary logic with high and low voltage levels representing 1 and 0. Logic gates perform Boolean operations, and flip-flops store binary information. Microprocessors execute instructions to process data.

Analog electronics deals with continuous signals, using operational amplifiers for signal processing. Filters remove unwanted frequencies, and oscillators generate periodic waveforms. Power electronics manages electrical energy conversion and control.`,
